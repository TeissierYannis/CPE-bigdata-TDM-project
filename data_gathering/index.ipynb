    "The code imports several libraries to work correctly. The libraries are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- tqdm is a library that provides a progress bar for loops and iteration, which is helpful for keeping track of the progress of long-running processes.\n",
    "- PIL (Python Imaging Library) is a library used for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.\n",
    "- The pickle library allows the user to serialize and deserialize Python objects, meaning that the user can save a Python object to a file and then load it back later.\n",
    "- The os library provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.\n",
    "- The zipfile library provides functionality to create, read, write, append, and list a ZIP file.\n",
    "- requests library is used for sending HTTP requests to web servers and downloading content.\n",
    "- functools is a module that implements higher-order functions. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as inputs, or that return functions as output.\n",
    "- pathlib is a library for working with file paths, which is part of the Python Standard Library starting from Python 3.4.\n",
    "- Finally, tqdm.auto automatically enables or disables the progress bar depending on the context of use, so that it only shows when the output is connected to a terminal or not."
